Chess Bot
=========

Chess Bot is a Unity project that we worked on for our final ICS4U project. This unity project allows you to play chess against an AI opponent which we developed.

Opening in Unity
---------------

1.  Make sure you have the latest version of Unity installed (2021.3.16 or higher).
2.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3.  Create a new project in Unity and drag the repository files over to the root directory of the new project. Replace any files it asks you to.
4.  Make changes ðŸš€

Configuration
-------------

You can configure various aspects of the game by modifying the scripts located in the `Assets/Scripts` directory. 

For example, if you wanted to modify the bots behaviour by changing each piece's value, you would go to `Assets/Scripts/ChessEngine.cs` and edit the `pieceValue` dictionary.

Adding changes to the game is pretty straightforward and you shouldn't have any troubles finding what you need.

The repository contains the following directories:

-   `Assets`: This directory contains all the assets (scripts, prefabs, graphics, etc.) that are used in the project.
